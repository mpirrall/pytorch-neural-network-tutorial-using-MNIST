# Pytorch Neural Network and Dataset Tutorial Using MNIST

This tutorial will cover creating a Pytorch Dataset with the MNIST dataset and using it to train a basic feedforward neural network in Pytorch.  There will be four main parts: extracting the MNIST data into a useable form, creating the neural network itself, training the network, and, lastly, testing it.

## Introduction

Pytorch is a dataset of handwritten images, often considered the 'Hello world!' of machine learning.  It is composed of 70,000 images, which are further split into 60,000 images designated for training neural networks and 10,000 designated for testing them.  While many tutorials for MNIST use a set that has already been preprocessed, this one will cover how to load the set from the raw files.  This method was chosen to give more experience with loading actual datasets, as most real world data is not neatly processed for you.  With that said, let's begin!

## What you need
Installing the following programs/packages can be difficult for a beginner.  I'll try to point you in the right direction, but if you are having trouble then you should look up more in-depth tutorials on that specific topic online before moving forward.

Anaconda and a console emulator:

* I would recommend having [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installed as it is great for downloading packages and just doing anything data science related in general.  I will be moving forward in this section assuming you have Anaconda.
* If you're on Windows and need a console emulator to work with Anaconda, I'd highly recommend [Cmder](https://cmder.net/).

Once you have Anaconda install:
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Scroll down and customize based on your system.  Choose *Conda* as you are using Anaconda, and if you don't know what CUDA is, choose *None*.  Run what you're given in your console (Cmder if you chose to use it) to download Pytorch.
* [Matplotlib](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/matplotlib)- Follow the link and run one of the commands in console.
* Numpy- You probably won't need to actually install this as it should come with Anaconda.

Once you have finished installing them, you can confirm you have them by running **conda list** in console and finding the packages in the list.

MNIST:
* We'll be using the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset for training and testing our neural network, so download the four files named **train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz**, **train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz**, **t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz**, and **t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz**.  As the website says, these are the images and labels for training and testing.
* Once the files are downloaded, extract them into an easy to find folder for later.

With that finished, we should be ready to code!
